# TDA_Protein3D

This repository contains some scripts that fetch protein structure predictions from the ESM Fold API (such as /notebooks/frugal_kos.py) for certain amino-acid sequences translated from the Tara Ocean prokaryote dataset. 

It also contains a notebook that tests different Topological Data Analyses approach on these structures to find some recurrent patterns and study the topological variance of the proteins between layers.
